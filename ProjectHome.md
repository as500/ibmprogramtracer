# iTrace: RPG program tracer #

---

Most of the commercial software profilers are very useful tools to analyze program execution. While the major part of object oriented programming languages have IDEs with integrated profilers, for the RPG programmers, this kind of tool is not very common. iTrace is a open-source tool which allows to trace the execution of a program, keeping track of every executed code line. This tool can be very helpful specially in the following cases:

  * Legacy modernization, specially in the program understanding phase
  * Business process mining
  * Test coverage analysis
  * Understand and improve the program flow

In order to install **iTrace**, check the [Installation Guide](InstallationGuide.md). Also, take a look at the ["How to use guide"](HowToUse.md) for samples.
